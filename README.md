## 🧱 Ontologies Used

| Ontology/Schema | Role |
|-----------------|------|
| [Brick Schema](https://brickschema.org) | Describes building components, zones, systems |
| [EFOnt](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/EnergyFlexibilityOntology) | Tags devices with flexibility service capabilities |
| [Custom Thermal RC Model](https://matinabtahi.github.io/operational_digital_twinning/thermal-model.ttl) | Extends Brick with thermal resistance/capacitance semantics |
| SHACL | Used for validating RDF structure and modeling rules |

---

## 🔎 Main Features

- ✅ **Semantic modeling** of buildings, HVAC zones, devices, sensors, and DERs
- 🔁 **Energy flexibility tagging** (LoadShifting, PeakShaving, etc.) via EFOnt
- 🧠 **RC grey-box models** integrated with semantic metadata
- 🧪 **SHACL validation** of modeling logic (e.g., thermostats must have both sensor and command)
- 📊 **SPARQL queries** to retrieve, group, and classify buildings and services
